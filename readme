# Network Clock Project

## Description

The Network Clock Project enables users to view the current time in a custom format and configure the system time. The project consists of:
- A server script that listens for requests and returns the current time in the requested format.
- A client script with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to request the time and set the system clock.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkcalendar for the graphical user interface
- Administrator privileges for updating the system time

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python package using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install tkcalendar

2. **Download the Project Files:**

    Ensure you have the following files:
        network_server.py: The server script for providing the current time.
        network_clock.py: The client script with the GUI for requesting and displaying the time.
        update_time.py: A script for updating the system time (requires administrator privileges).

## Usage

1. **Start the Server:**

    Launch the server script to begin listening for requests:

   ```sh
   python3 network_server.py

The server will listen on the port specified in config.txt or default to port 12345 if the configuration file is missing.

2. **Run the Client:**

Start the graphical user interface by running:

   ```sh
    python3 network_clock.py
   ```

* Enter Format String: Input the desired time format string. For example, **YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS.**

* Update Time: Click the "Update Time" button to refresh the displayed time.
* Select Date and Time: Use the calendar and spinboxes to choose and set the date and time.
* Set System Time: Click "Set System Time" to update the system clock with the selected date and time. This operation requires administrator privileges.

## Format Specifiers##

The format string can include the following specifiers:

   * YYYY - Full year (e.g., 2024)
   * yy - Two-digit year (e.g., 24)
   * MM - Month (01 to 12)
   * DD - Day of the month (01 to 31)
   * HH - Hour (00 to 23)
   * mm - Minutes (00 to 59)
   * SS - Seconds (00 to 59)

## Troubleshooting##

   * Ensure the server is running before starting the client.
   * Verify you have the necessary permissions to update the system time.
   * If the client displays "Invalid format," check the format string for correctness.
